# Temperature-Based-Fan-Speed-Control-Using-Arduino
This project focuses on controlling the speed of a fan based on room temperature using an Arduino and LM35 temperature sensor. The sensor detects the temperature and sends an analog signal to the Arduino, which then processes it and adjusts the fan speed accordingly using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). A 2N2222 transistor acts like a switch to control the fan, and an LCD display shows the current temperature and fan speed in real time. The fan turns on when the temperature crosses 30Â°C, making it ideal for automatic cooling systems. This project teaches how microcontrollers can be used to automate everyday appliances based on environmental changes.
